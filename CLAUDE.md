# Claude repository handoff

Before committing, pushing, or changing the current uncommitted merchant work, read:

- replit.md
- .agents/memory/MEMORY.md
- docs/HANDOFF-2026-07-20-onboarding-billing-tutorial.md

The 2026-07-20 handoff is authoritative for the onboarding redesign, billing-card prerequisite, crypto-payment removal, tutorial mode, migrations, test status, and staging exclusions.

Do not blindly run git add -A. Exclude .claude-home/** and .claude/settings.local.json, preserve the requested source changes, and review the generated client/public/app hash rollover as a single unit.
